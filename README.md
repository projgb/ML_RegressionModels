## Understanding Regression models under Supervised Machine Learning

# Introduction 
Regression models are used for continuous (numerical) data to estimate specific values (saleprice of property, salary prediction). Regression models are single and multiple linear regression, SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) regression.

# Description of learning
A sample housing data set is used for comparing different regression models. Outcome from various models is compared and displayed in chart format.

# Sample display of various models performance comparison


# Code sample
Jupyter notebook 'RegressionModels.ipynb' contains the source code used for this learning exercise.
